                            <p align="left"> <b> People with mental health problems are violent and unpredictable. </b> </p>
                            <p> People can be highly active and productive members of a community while having a mental illness. </p>
                            <p> <b> People with mental illnesses never get better. </b> </p>
                            <p> Mental illnesses are treatable, and with the right kind of help, most people do recover and lead healthy, productive, and satisfying lives. </p>
                            <p> <b> People with mental illnesses can "pull themselves out of it". </b> </p>
                            <p> A mental illness is not caused by personal weakness, and is not cured by personal strength. </p>
                            <p> <b> Treatment is a waste of time </b> </p>
                            <p> Whether it is medication or therapy, treatment can be extremely beneficial. </p>
                            <p> <b> Mental illness isn't common </b> </p>

                            <p> You can do many things to help people with mental illnesses, such as treating them with the respect and dignity that they deserve. </p>
                            <p> <b> People are faking or doing it for attention. </b> <p>
                            <p> No one would choose to have a mental illness, just as no one would choose to have a physical illness. </p>
                            <p> <b> Mental illnesses will never effect me </b> <p>
                            <p> Family, friends, and co-workers can have a mental illness. </p>
                            <p> <b> Everyone gets depressed as they grow older. It's just a part of the aging process </b> <p>
                            <p> Older adults have a higher risk of depression, but it's not an inevitable part of aging. </p>
